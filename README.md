# Oy Me UP basic python skills
In this project I have analysed two datasets as csv file, using basic Python scripting skills. (lists, for loop, counters, if statment and statics)

# PyBank
* In this folder, I have created a Python script to analyse the financial records for a give set of financial data called [budget_data.csv](PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv). The dataset is composed of two columns: `Date` and `Profit/Losses`. 

* I have createed a Python script that analyses the records to calculate each of the following:
  * The total `number of months` 
  * The `net total amount` of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
  * Calculate the `changes in "Profit/Losses"` over the entire period, then find the 'average' of those changes
  * The `greatest increase` in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
  * The `greatest decrease` in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

# PyPoll
 * I have analysed a set of poll data called [election_data.csv](PyPoll/Resources/election_data.csv). The dataset is composed of three columns: `Voter ID`, `County`, and `Candidate`. 
 * I have createed a Python script that analyses the records to calculate each of the following:
   * The total number of votes cast
   * A complete list of candidates who received votes
   * The percentage of votes each candidate won
   * The total number of votes each candidate won
   * The winner of the election based on popular vote.
