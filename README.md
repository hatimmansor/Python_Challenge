# Oy Me UP basic python skills
In this project I have analysed two datasets as csv file, using basic Python scripting skills. (lists, for loop, counters, if statment and statics)

# [PyBank]
* In this folder, I have created a Python script to analyse the financial records for a give set of financial data called [budget_data.csv](PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv). The dataset is composed of two columns: `Date` and `Profit/Losses`. 

* I have createed a Python script that analyses the records to calculate each of the following:
  * The total number of months 
  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
  * Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes
  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
  * The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

# [PyPoll]
  * this folder contain the sorce data as csv file, the results as text file and main python code as python file
